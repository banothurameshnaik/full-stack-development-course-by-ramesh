What is CSS?
    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
    CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
    CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
    External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.

CSS Syntax
    selector property: value
    h1 { color: blue; font-size: 24px }

    The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
    The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

    Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

    Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

        color: red;
        text-align: center;
    }
